# Introduction
The `Basic Design System` is a simple bare bones design system that demonstrates the core functionality of the toolkit. It's not intended for production use, but rather a test design system used to drive the core functionality. That said, it will (must) use all the core functionality.

# Design Tokens
These are a minimal set of design tokens for a functional design system.

## Color

## Elevation

## Motion

## Shape

## Typography
Font-Family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif.

| Token                | Value                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| bd-typography-font   | Arial                              |
